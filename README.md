| Maximum Value Tracker  | Array | This C++ program allows users to input an array's size and its elements. It then iterates through the array, tracking the maximum value encountered. During each iteration, it displays the current maximum value found. |
| Sum Of Subarrays  | Array | This C++ program prompts the user to enter the size of an array and its elements. It then calculates and displays the sum of all possible subarrays of the given array.  |
| Longest Arithmetic Subarray  | Array | This C++ program prompts the user to input the size of an array and its elements. It then identifies and calculates the length of the longest arithmetic subarray within the given array.  |
| Record Breaker  | Array | This C++ program prompts the user to input the number of elements in an array and its elements. It then identifies the number of "record-breaking" days in the array. A day is considered record-breaking if the number of visitors on that day is greater than the number of visitors on the previous day as well as the following day.  |
